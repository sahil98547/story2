Round and Round
John Kitching ​

Round and round the playground,

Marching in a line,

I’ll hold your hand.

You hold mine.

 

Round and round the playground

Skipping in a ring

Everybody loves it

When we all sing.

 

Round and round the playground 

That’s what we like:

Climbing on the climbing frame,

Riding on the bike.

 

Round and round the playground,

All together friends.

We’re sad, sad, sad

When the school day ends.
